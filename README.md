# Blog360

Created during a 3 day Hackathon project as part of Fullstack Academy's remote program. This project won the "Mad Scientist Award" for most unique, ambitious and well-executed out of the remote cohort's Hackathon projects.

My first application using React-VR. Application is a proof of concept for a Personal VR Blog idea I had several months prior.

**Utilizes:** React-VR and photos taken by a Ricoh Theta S.
